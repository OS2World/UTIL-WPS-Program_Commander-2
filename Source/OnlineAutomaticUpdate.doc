While you can easily test the retrieval of the URL part of the Online 
Automatic Update feature, it is difficult to test the Registration part,
because one has to simulate the Cgi-Bin of Geocities which is used for
that purpose.

To make a simulation with a local Web-Server (e.g. IBM's ICS or Lotus Go are
the ones I'm using) do the following:

1) In the Registration notebook page replace the Url by
   http://localhost/homepagegeocities/AutoUpdate.html
   where localhost is the host running the Web-Server and the 
   \homepagegeocities\ directory on your Web-Server contains a copy of 
   AutoUpdate.html.

   That should be enough to test the URL part from your browser.

2) Use the OnlineAutomaticUpdate.html page to verify you installed the 
   Registration part correctly:
   *) Copy Mail.cmd into the \CGI-BIN\homestead\ of your Web-Server
   *) You may want to run the logs on your Web-Server to ensure it does
      the same as IBM's ICS that is if not *.pl (Perl) script is found
      it tries to run *.cmd instead (e.g. the Registration uses
      according to the Geocities conventions a mail.pl script, but when
      not having Perl installed that can be simulated by just providing
      mail.cmd instead to ICS.

   That should be enough to test the Registration part from your browser.

3) Now run PC/2's Online Automatic Update. It should now be able to use
   your local Web-Server.

By the way, PC/2 posts during the Registration part:
   POST /cgi-bin/homestead/mail.pl\?warpguru HTTP/1.0\r\n
   Connection: Close\r\nUser-Agent: PC/2 2.20 (OS/2; I)\r\n
   Pragma: no-cache\r\nHost: pc770.pc.com\r\n
   Accept: text/html, text/plain, 
   Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n
   Content-length: 183\r\n\r\n
